# MyProjects
A collection of C++ programs.

Here is a collection of all my recent C++ Projects. All files are included in the master branch, while each
subsequent branch represents a unique project. 

1) The Binary Search Tree is a basic data structure. This Binary Search Tree program reads in 
symbols and integers from a file that indicates which functions should be performed on the Binary Tree.

2) Hash Table is a basic data structure. This Hash Table program allows users to choose from 
a variety of 3 hash functions in order to distribute data read in from a file.

3) The HeapSort program sorts data from a file using the Heap Sort algorithm

4) Merge Sort reads in data from 2 external files and creates a new file to hold the 
combined and sorted data.

5) The 8 queens problem is one that aims to place 8 queens on a chess table in a layout
where it's impossible for any queen on the board to attack its neighboring queens. There were multiple programming techniques utilized in the nuances of these programs.

6) The extras include a program which sorts data, and a program which calculates data from
a randomly filled 2-d array.

Enjoy!
